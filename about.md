I am currently a full-time graduate student at North Carolina State University and will be completing my master's degree in statistics in July 2020. I have earned bachelor's degrees in statistics and finance from the University of Florida (Go Gators!). In the past, I have interned as a Data Science Intern at Jabil and as an Analytics Intern at The Walt Disney Company. During the summer of 2020, I will be a part of the Data Science Accelerator Internship Program at Truist Bank. Upon completion of my graduate degree and my internship program at Truist, I look forward to beginning my career as a Data Scientist and further continuing my Data Science journey!
