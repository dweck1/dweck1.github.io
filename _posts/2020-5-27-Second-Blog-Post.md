The language besides R that I have used the most is Python. Overall, I find both of the languages pretty fun and easy to use. Perhaps because I mainly use R in all my stats classes, I like the functionality R has for statistical applications/tests over that of Python. When dealing with more complex machine learning algorithms, though, scikit-learn is definitely the go-to option. I think data wrangling with the tidyverse is pretty straightforward, although I would probably prefer using pandas in Python. While using R, the main thing that I miss about Python is the simplicity in the syntax. With R, the syntax can vary quite a bit when doing one task or another, which makes it more confusing. It is because of this that I would say learning R is a bit tougher than Python. When learning R, the tidyverse is obviously incredibly important, and its consistent syntax makes that pretty easy. But as a whole, I find Python to be easier to learn than R.
