As the semester is coming to an end and I look back on what I have learned, I can really see how far I have come. I think I had a good understanding of what a data scientist does coming into this class, so I do not think that has changed much; however I have become much more proficient in using R to do data science.  
  
Prior to this course, I had used R in a lot of classes, but never to do any machine learning tasks. With all of the assignments in this class, I was able to see how useful R can be for training models, especially the `caret` package. Because I have gotten more experience with R, I do think that I will use it more going forward. I think whether I use R or Python might depend on the specific project, but my eyes have definetely been opened to how effective R can be for data science.  
  
Going forward, one thing that I can see myself doing differently is using `ggplot2` to create better visualizations and maybe even using `shiny` for a dashboard. I now feel a lot more comfortable with these tools and have seen their ease of use so I will probably use them in the future to create more effective visualizations and dashboards.
